<h1>TClass usage</h1>

<h2>Basics</h2>

This page assumes that you have already installed TClass successfully
and have some background in machine learning and have possibly even
read the paper and/or PhD on TClass. Once you have ensured that both
TClass and Weka are in your CLASSPATH environment variable, all you
need to do to run TClass is:
<p>
</p><pre>% java tclass.TClass
</pre>
<p>
Of course, it generally helps if you do this in a directory that is set up for
TClass (we will call these TClass experiment directories), for example if 
$TCLASS_HOME is where you installed TClass, try for 
example,$TCLASS_HOME/data/techsupport/.</p><p>
TClass requires several files. These are:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li><b>Domain description file:</b> (Default: tclass.tdd) This file describes 
thedomain of interest: the number of channels, their types etc. etc.
</li><li><b>Training set:</b> (Default: tclass.tsl) This file lists the name of each 
datafile that contains a training time series and each time series' class.
</li><li><b>Test set</b>: (Default: tclass.ttl) This file lists the name of each data 
filethat contains a testing time series and its class.
</li><li><b>Run settings</b>: (Default: tclass.tal) This file describes which 
metafeatures to extract from which channels and how to cluster them.
</li></ul>

In addition, in most TClass experiment directories, you will find a "data" 
subdirectory which contains the actual time series data. Time series data are 
indicated by a ".tsd"suffix. These and more are described in my PhD, in 
particular 
<a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/%7Ewaleed/phd/html/node78.html">this 
section on the practical implementation</a> of TClass.<p></p>
<h2>TClass command line options</h2>

TClass currently supports the following command line options:

<ul>
<li>-tr <i>filename</i>: Use <i>filename</i> for the training set.
</li><li>-te <i>filename</i>: Use <i>filename</i> for the test set.
</li><li>-dd <i>filename</i>: Use <i>filename</i> for the domain description. 
</li><li>-s <i>filename</i>: Use <i>filename</i> for the settings for the learning 
task. 

</li><li>-l <i>learner</i>: Use <i>learner</i> (where <i>learner</i> is a weka 
class) instead of the default <code>weka.classifiers.j48.J48</code>. Note that 
you can use ":" as a separator. So for example, if you wanted to use part, but 
with a minimum of 5 examples per leaf node (usually expressed at the command 
line as -M 5), it could be given as 
<code>-l weka.classifiers.j48.PART:-M:5</code>. Likewise, to use AdaBoost with 
J48 as the base learner, this could be given as 
<code>-l weka.classifiers.AdaBoostM1:-W:weka.classifiers.j48.J48</code>
</li><li>-md: Make a description of the 
extracted rule, using the methoddescribed in the PhD Thesis. This takes a 
synthetic feature, andtranslates it to a more human-readable form. <b>Note: 
</b>Currently,this only works with directed clustering and decision rule or 
decisiontree based learners that produce attribute-value comparisons (such as x 
&lt;= 1). 
</li></ul>

<h2>Hints</h2>

TClass has been developed and tested using JDK 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4. 
<p>
</p>
Some java implementations have a <code>-server</code> option, designed 
for code continually running on servers. It seems to do more code optimisation 
in this case. Empirical experience suggests that if your TClass process is 
likely to run for more than 10 minutes, the -server improves performance. For 
processes running for more than a few hours, we have found up to a 25 per cent 
reduction in running time. <p>
Also note that because of the size of the datasets, you may have to increase 
the amount of RAM available to java processes. This is typically done through 
the <code>-Xmx</code> command -- e.g. <code>-Xmx200m</code> to give a java 
process 200 megabytes of RAM</p>
